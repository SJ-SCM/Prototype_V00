# Prototype_V00
Prototype: local implementation

The workflow uses the V4 region of bacterial S16. Enter the program via a simplified main section and set the dataset (hiq_v4.fa) in the working directory. The accuracy is currently at ~72% when the program chooses between approximately 1200 species of bacteria from the input sequence of 250 nucleotides. 

The following steps are:

(1) increase the dataset 

(2) compare the results to a basic alignment
